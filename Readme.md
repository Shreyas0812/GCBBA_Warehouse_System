# GCBBA Warehouse System

## Overview
This project implements a warehouse management system using GCBBA and Collision Avoidance with changing Communication Graph.

## Experimental Hardware

All experiments were executed on an **AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS** (8 cores, 3.3 GHz base clock, 5.1 GHz boost) with **12 GB LPDDR5X RAM** running **Windows 11**.

The simulation runs as a single-threaded Python process (CPython, subject to the GIL). Reported wall-clock times are therefore hardware-dependent and should be interpreted as **relative comparisons across methods** rather than absolute benchmarks. Simulation-time metrics — throughput, task wait time, queue depth, collision and deadlock counts — are hardware-independent and constitute the primary experimental results.

## Note on Repository Structure

This repository consolidates code developed across multiple separate repositories. For detailed git histories and development timelines of individual components, please refer to the original repositories from which each module was integrated.
